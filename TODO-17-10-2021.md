## TODO 17/10/2021

1. Having to change the "base" setting in main.yaml all the time when pulling is annoying. I wasn't going to include the main config file in the repo originally to avoid these kind of instance related differences. However, now it is there, lets change the Essentials class so it deduces "base" relative to the script path. We can have it use the "base" setting in the config only if this is specified (and then we can remove it from the yaml to avoid having to update it).

2. transfer the %.equations and %.params in Identifier_Param to params.yaml. See comments in params.yaml

3. expand and complete the list of synonyms for params. I prepared the list of equations and the params that are there currently by taking the param names from the test income sheet and searching those param names on investopedia. This explains the relationship between quantities, and provides synonyms. The list of equations I prepared for Income is fairly exhaustive (at least exhaustive enough for now). However, the synonyms list needs completing (but complete in params.yaml rather than in Identifier_Param)

4. further to the above, the same process needs to be done for Cashflow and Balance (ie using test spreadsheets and investopedia)

5. move "identifier" method in Identifier_Sheet to Identifier, call it "find_best_combo" and make generic. Create new "identifier" method in Identifier_Sheet which calls "find_best_combo" (see comments in Identifier_Sheet)

6. as part of the above, resolve how we are going to handle Scorecards, fuzzywuzzy etc.

7. create the "index" method in Identifier_Param, and create a script to call it. This script should be called whenever params.yaml changes to keep the index up to date. See the comments in Identifier_Param.

8. create the "identify" method in Identifier_Param. This is going to be the tough nut to crack and not for the faint-hearted. But at least it is fairly explicitly described in the comments in Identifier_Param (possibly?!)
