# "expected_sign" is whether or not we would expect the quantity
# to be positive or negative. e.g. we expect an "expense" to
# be negative. the reason for inclusion is because sometimes
# financial statements will list an expense positively, but take
# the value away when summing to get net value, and sometimes
# it will be listed negatively and then added. (nb i think we will
# not use "expected_sign" in our initial test cases as we will
# list them all negatively
#
# the "collect" setting defines whether this is a parameter we need
# to output at the end (ie. currently the 8 params for income,
# 14 for cashflow and 23 for balance)
